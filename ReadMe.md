<h1 id="todoly---a-simple-to-do-list-application">ToDoLy - a simple to do list Application!</h1>
<p>ToDoLy is a simple text based to-do list application. The user is able to add, edit, display, remove and save tasks all from the comfort of their terminal. When <em><strong>adding</strong></em> a task one is able to set the task title, the project it belongs to, its due date and status (open or done) and these fields maybe be adjusted after the intial creation of the task, <em><strong>editing ;)</strong></em> . When one wants to see the entirety of their to-do list all they need do is display their tasks using the aforefentioned <em><strong>display function</strong></em>! The tasks may be stylishly displayed according to their project handles or due dates for your viewing pleasure. The application implements a task number system so to edit and <em><strong>remove</strong></em>  one needs to know the number of the task they want to mamnipulate. How, one might ask, is the user supposed to know this number? Have no fear, as when ever one edits or removes, the tasks are displayed for the users perusal of the relevant task numbers. When the user is done using the application, all they need to do to make sure all they’re important tasks are still there the next time, is <strong>save</strong> and <strong>quit</strong>, now conventiently located within one single action!</p>

<h1 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h1>
<p>Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your <strong>Google Drive</strong>, your <strong>Dropbox</strong> and your <strong>GitHub</strong> accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow… The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.</p>
<p>There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-a-file">Open a file</h2>
<p>You can open a file from <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> by opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Open from</strong>. Once opened in the workspace, any modification in the file will be automatically synced.</p>
<h2 id="save-a-file">Save a file</h2>
<p>You can save any file of the workspace to <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong> or <strong>GitHub</strong> by opening the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu and clicking <strong>Save on</strong>. Even if a file in the workspace is already synced, you can save it to another location. StackEdit can sync one file with multiple locations and accounts.</p>
<h2 id="synchronize-a-file">Synchronize a file</h2>
<p>Once your file is linked to a synchronized location, StackEdit will periodically synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be resolved.</p>
<p>If you just have modified your file and you want to force syncing, click the <strong>Synchronize now</strong> button in the navigation bar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Synchronize now</strong> button is disabled if you have no file to synchronize.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="manage-file-synchronization">Manage file synchronization</h2>
<p>Since one file can be synced with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking <strong>File synchronization</strong> in the <strong>Synchronize</strong> sub-menu. This allows you to list and remove synchronized locations that are linked to your file.</p>
